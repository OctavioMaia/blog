== Introduction 

Welcome to my review of the Xero S5M "Silver Edition". +
Before heading further into this review, I’d like to thank Eddie for sending over the frame for review.

== Overview

The Xero S5M is a new frame by Avant designed to be used with the new generation of micro cameras, the Foxeer Arrow Micro and Runcam Micro Swift. +
It sports a stretched-X configuration, making it ideal for racing, where the stretched-X profile has advantages over the classic true-x configuration. +
Nothing on this frame feels cheap or poorly made. The carbon is cut in 45º degrees, offering more stiffness than a standard cut. +
The frame edges are also chamfered, allowing for better resistance in case of heavy crashes, since it helps to prevent delamination of the carbon fibre layers. +
The frame also allows for 20mm x 20mm and 30.55mm x 30.5mm mounting which is usefull nowadays since 20mm x 20mm eletronics are becoming more popular due to higher amperage AIO ESC and tinier flight controllers. +
So last but not least, the frame features 3 motor mounting points instead of 4. This has been a recent update to the design to help add stiffness in that area since there have been some issues regarding heavy crashes.

So let's take a closer look at the frame itself.

*What's in the box:*

* 4mm unibody main plate.
* 2mm top plate.
* 2mm camera mounting plate.
* Kit including bolts, nuts and spacers.
* Battery strap.
* Stickers.

== Analysis

*How does this all go together?*

The Xero S5M is a very easy frame to assemble. It sports countersunk nylon screws on the bottom side of the main plate and countersunk high tensile steel screws on the top plate.

*So what stands out on this frame?*

One of the first things that stood out to me was the extremely good build quality of all the parts present in this frame! +
The use of Aluminium 7075 really improves the rigidity of the frame, resulting in a very strong cage that protects both lenses and the components inside. +

The carbon cut is also excellent, one of the best I've ever seen, nothing like the cheap clone frames that are sold everywhere. I'd put this right beside my SCX-200 V2.3 by Armattan in terms of carbon fiber quality.

Another great touch is the HD camera mounting options. +
Gladly Dquad provides a way to quickly attach an HD camera to the rollcage via 4 screws, making this a very quick and easy installation. +
They also provide the STL files required to print your own protection right on their website, alongside arm and LiPo protectors and XT60 mounts.

== Conclusion

Would I recommend this frame to anyone who's looking for a premium build quality and durability? +
Absolutely. Aside from the hefty price tag I cannot think of a single reason not to recommend this frame. 

It's sleek, good looking, great durability and has spare parts in case you ever need them. +
Great job Dquad!
