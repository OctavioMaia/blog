== Introduction 

Welcome to my review of the Xero S5M "Silver Edition". +
Before heading further into this review, I’d like to thank Eddie for sending over the frame for review.

== Overview

The Xero S5M is a new frame by Avant designed to be used with the new generation of micro cameras, the Foxeer Arrow Micro and Runcam Micro Swift. +
It sports a stretched-X configuration, making it ideal for racing, where the stretched-X profile has advantages over the classic true-x configuration. +
Nothing on this frame feels cheap or poorly made. The carbon is cut in 45º degrees, offering more stiffness than a standard cut. +
The frame edges are also chamfered, allowing for better resistance in case of heavy crashes, since it helps to prevent delamination of the carbon fibre layers. +
The frame also allows for 20mm x 20mm and 30.55mm x 30.5mm mounting which is usefull nowadays since 20mm x 20mm eletronics are becoming more popular due to higher amperage AIO ESC and tinier flight controllers. +
So last but not least, the frame features 3 motor mounting points instead of 4. This has been a recent update to the design to help add stiffness in that area since there have been some issues regarding heavy crashes. +
The FPV camera can be screwed in two places, either closer or further away from the flight controller. +
The frame comes in at 65$, which I consider to be a steal! It's cheap when you factor in the quality you're getting here.

*What's in the box:*

* 1x 4mm unibody main plate.
* 1x 2mm top plate.
* 2x 2mm camera mounting plate (28mm height).
* Kit including bolts, nuts and spacers.
* Battery strap.
* Stickers.

== Analysis

*So what stands out on this frame?* +
One of the first things that stood out to me was the extremely good build quality of all the parts present in this frame! +
The machining on the carbon is top notch. It even comes pre-chamfered from the factory. +

The carbon being cut in 45º also makes a huge difference. The flex is almost non-existent, allowing just for a tiny bit of flexing (this is good, because if a frame is too rigid it won't allow for flexing in a hard crash).

*How does this all go together?* +
The Xero S5M is a very easy frame to assemble. It sports countersunk nylon screws on the bottom side of the main plate and countersunk high tensile steel screws on the top plate. +
This makes for a very clean and aesthetically pleasing build.

*Final build:* +
In order to save the most possible space I used a Racerstar StarF3S AIO FC + PDB + 30A ESC, making this a single stack machine. +
A Foxeer Micro was also used along with a Eachine VTX03 w/ a dipole antenna. +
BoltRC 2207 2450KV motors were also used, making this a super light and capable racer.

The build ended up weighing 259g w/ a strap and 4x Cyclone 5045C props.

== Conclusion

Would I recommend this frame to anyone who's looking for a premium build quality and durability? +
Absolutely! AvantQuads has definitely hit a sweetspot here. +
A good compromise of weight, durability, looks and most important price! +
It's sleek, good looking, great durability and has spare parts in case you ever need them. +

*Pros:*

	* Superb carbon.
    * Cut in 45º for maximum durability.
    * Use of high tensile steel + countersunk screws.
    * Great looks.
    * FPV camera is well protected.
    * Very lightweight (63g w/ hardware).
    
*Cons:*

	* Lower standoffs + camera mounting plates would be preferred (probably add an option with 20mm standoffs for ultra low builds).
