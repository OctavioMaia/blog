== Introduction 

Welcome to my overview and first look of the Wraith32 BLHeli_32 ESC. +
Thanks to Airbot for sending me these ESC for an overview!

Before heading further into this overview please take into consideration that these ESC are a pre-production test sample that are not representative of the final product in any way. +
They cannot be updated to the final firmware neither have functions like telemetry and current sensing working as of now.


== Specifications

* BLHeli_32
* ARM 32bit MCU
* Build in Current sensor
* On-Board RGB LED
* 2-6s LIPO input
* 35A continuous (50A burst)
* 15*30mm

== Unboxing

Once I opened the package I was greeted by a letter explaining that this was a test sample and the limitations that it has.

A small BLHeli_32 manual was also included, of which I will disclose the first page.

== Closer look

The ESC packaging was very simple, just an antistatic bag, no cables, or anything. +
Remember this is a test sample ESC.

As you can see on the top side of the ESC, you have a current sensor on the bottom, as well as big solder pads for your main battery leads. +

On the bottom side you can also solder if you wish to. +
This is also usefull in the rare case a pad is ripped off the PCB.

== User experience

As of today (10th of May of 2017) DSHOT1200 isn't 100% functional as far as I know. +
The only way to connect to these ESC is via an Arduino since BLHeliSuite does not recognize them. +
Current F3 boards aren't able to keep up, but F4 and F7 do keep up. +
This being said, this ESC works perfectly on DSHOT600 with no desyncs and once DSHOT1200 is working 100% I'll be sure to try it out.

Soldering to the pads was a dream. I'm a fan of bare ESC so I can cut my own cables to length. +
The only possible downside would be the GND and PWM pad, which I found a bit small but workable nonetheless.

== Ending thoughts

Would I recommend that you jump on BLHeli_32 once it releases? +
No. Sadly it will probably be a "green" software in the first times and it being closed-source is a letdown for me.

I'd recommend you'd wait some weeks at least to get some solid feedback from early adopters.

*Pros:*

	* Runs BLHeli_32.
	* DSHOT1200.
    * Small size.
    * 35A capable.
    * 2-6S capable.
    
*Cons:*

	* Early adopter fee may be high. (early software may have bugs)
