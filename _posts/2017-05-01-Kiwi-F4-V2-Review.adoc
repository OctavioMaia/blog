== Introduction 

Welcome to my review of the Kiwi.F4 V2 Flight Controller and the Kiwi PDB. +
Before heading further into this review, I’d like to thank the John Lemon for making this review possible!

== Overview

Let's start off by taking a closer look at the packaging. +
As we can see FlyingLemon is using a nice cardboard box, which may not seem special at first, but after opening it up we see specially cut holes for both the Flight Controller and PDB.

In the box we'll find both the Flight controller and PDB, plus some nylon hardware. +
An overall good package from FlyingLemon.

*Specifications:*

* Up to 6S input.

* F4 MCU running @170mhz.

* MPU6000 gyro.

* 12V/0.7A linear BEC for video line w/ LC-Filter

* Switching 5V step-down rated @ 600mA

* Betaflight OSD

* VBAT, RSSI, Current sensor (up to 160A)

* SBUS inverter

* Full sized SD Card slot.

* etc.


== Analysis

One of the first things that stood out to me was the extremely good build quality of both parts! +
I'm also glad that they are now using pads instead of through holes on the FC, which makes for much easier wiring.

On the back side we'll find the SD Card slot, the ATMEL chip that runs the OSD, the 5V step-down and a special pin connector that we'll discuss further in this review.

== Diving further into the Kiwi.V2

So what makes the Kiwi.V2 any good? +
For once, it's a completely modular system that doesn't require the use of the Kiwi PDB.

* Ripped off a signal pad on the PDB? +
Use the spare one on the Flight controller. 

* You don't feel like using the included PDB, but want to take advantage of the 12V filtering? +
No problem, use any PDB of your choice. The Kiwi has the 12V regulator on the FC itself.

The other major selling point to me is the combination of both FC and PDB. +
I believe the Kiwi.V1 was the first available product to use such a ingenious system! +
Wire your motors and signal wire to the PDB and through pins, connect both the FC and PDB for a super clean build and short stack. 

Here's how it looks.

== Conclusion

Would I recommend this FC and PDB? Yes! +
I'm yet to find someone that combines this well.

I may be a huge fan of my RROSD and FC combo, but this stack is way smaller and cleaner looking. +
The video feed is just perfect and extremely clean.

*Pros:*

	* Extremely well built.
    * Allows up to 160A on the current sensor.
    * 6S capable.
    * Full sized SD Card slot.
    * Compact stack.
    * Extremely well laid out.
    * Quality components.
    * Extremely well laid out pads.
    * FC + PDB communication between pins.
    * Extremely clean filtering.
	* Well priced.
    * Sold in the EU.
    
*Cons:*

	* Finding them in stock can be difficult.
