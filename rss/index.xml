<p>Welcome to my review of the SkyRC Q200 review.<br>
Before heading further into this review, I’d like to thank Shawn Tong over at SkyRC for sending me this charger and making all of this possible!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s firstly take a look at the box that the Q200 comes in.</p>

<p><strong>[ACCESSORIES PICTURES]</strong><br>
But what is the big deal about this new charger from SkyRC?<br>
It’s the latest 4-port charger from SkyRC, making it very useful for charging multiple LiPo batteries at the same time without resorting to parallel boards that can often cause unbalanced cells or other issues.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>[BATTERIES CHARGING PICTURES]</strong><br>
The charger has a power switch, which I consider very useful and also has two cooling fans, which while charging are very silent, but when discharging 4 batteries at the same time they can ramp up quite easily.<br>
The Q200 main advantage over it’s competition is it’s compact size and the 4 completely independent charging ports, that can easily be configured to charge different chemistry batteries at the same time, without causing issues to other packs. This is very useful when charging LiPo and Li-Ion 18650 cells. It’s also LiHV compatible, which not all chargers are. <br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>[LIPO AND LI ION CHARGING PIC]</strong><br>
It also allows for AC input without the need for a power supply, due to its integrated power supply. It’s also capable of using DC current, which can be useful for field charging with a car battery or even a big LiPo battery.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>[POWERBANK PIC]</strong><br>
It’s a very intuitive charger, and can be controlled like all standard 4-button chargers, with another button to control which channel is selected. Everything is displayed on a very nice quality colour screen, with a resolution of 480x320 pixels.<br>
It also allows for customizable power outputs between channels A/C and B/D when using AC mode.<br>
By default each channel is set at 50W, but can easily be changed. This can be useful if you’re charging a big mAh LiPo battery, like a 5000mAh unit since you can set appropriate wattage values for charging. <br>
Once you setup the desired wattage on channel A, for example 79W, then channel C will automatically be set to 21W due to the 100W restriction.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Channels A/C can be used to charge up to 10A, while C/D can charge up to 5A.<br>
Discharge rates are limited to 10W per channel, which for 4s is 0.6A per channel.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>[DISCHARGE PICTURE]</strong><br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Along with standard features like Battery meter, it also supports IR Resistance measurement, which is useful for battery maintenance and tracking.<br>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another feature of the Q200 charger is that it has its own Bluetooth app for smartphones.<br>
From what I’ve been able to tell Bluetooth is always on, although it would be nice if it had an option to turn it off in the settings.<br>
Although thinking I would rarely use this app I find it very useful and have come to use it very often. I have set a QR code for LiPo balance charging, which I use often with the app.<br>
All I have to do is I scan the QR code and it automatically starts balance charging my 4S LiPo batteries at 1.3A, which is very useful and straight-forward.</p>
